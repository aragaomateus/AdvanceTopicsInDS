    "# Problem 6 - Batch Normalization, Dropout, MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization and Dropout are used as effective regularization techniques. However its not clear which one should be preferred and whether their benefits add up when used in conjunction. In this problem we will compare batch normalization, dropout, and their conjunction using MNIST and LeNet-5 (see e.g., http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/). LeNet-5 is one of the earliest convolutional neural network developed for image classification and its implementation in all major framework is available. You can refer to Lecture 3 slides for definition of standardization and batch normalization."

In standard normalization the mean and standard deviation are calculated using the entire training dataset whereas in batch normalization these statistics are calculated for each mini-batch. Train LeNet-5 with standard normalization of input and batch normalization for hidden layers. What are the learned batch norm parameters for each layer ?"
