# Problem 5 - ML Cloud Platforms 15 points

In this question you will analyze different ML cloud platforms and compare their service offerings. In particular, you will consider ML cloud offerings from IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and compare them on the basis of following criteria:

1. Frameworks: DL framework(s) supported and their version. (4)
Here we are referring to machine learning platforms which have their own inbuilt images for different frameworks.

2. Compute units: type(s) of compute units offered, i.e., GPU types. (1)

3. Model lifecycle management: tools supported to manage ML model lifecycle. (2)

4. Monitoring: availability of application logs and resource (GPU, CPU, memory) usage monitoring data to the user. (2)

5. Visualization during training: performance metrics like accuracy and throughput (2)

6. Training job description: training job description file format. Show how the same training job is specified in different ML platforms. Identify similar fields in the training job file for the 4 ML platforms through an example. (4)
